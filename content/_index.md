Welcome to my slice of the internet! 🏡

I am **Saasha Nair**. I work on AI policy for the UK Government, and when I am not doing that, I am either falling down research rabbit holes or pretending my Netflix binges count as "quality time with my partner.” 🙃

This space is where I jot down my thoughts, mostly on AI, but also on whatever else has me hooked at the moment. 

Feel free to look around and explore my writing, or [read more about me](/about). Who knows, you might stumble upon something interesting! ♥️
