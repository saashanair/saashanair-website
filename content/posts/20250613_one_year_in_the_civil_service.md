Wow. It has officially been a year since I joined the civil service, and I honestly do not know where the time has gone! In typical me fashion, and thanks to the nature of my role, I have had the opportunity to get involved in a wide range of projects. Some made it out into the world. Some led to great conversations but ended up on hold. A few never got off the ground at all. Each one of these has taught me a lot along the way.

## What I've Learned So Far

Looking back, here are some of the biggest things I have learned over the past twelve months.

### 1. Change is the only constant
Yes, we have all heard that one before. It is a bit of a clichÃ© at this point, but it is also absolutely true. I do not think I have experienced this much organisational change in any other job I have had.

Since the day I joined, things have been in constant flux. First the general elections, then [RTA being absorbed into different teams across DSIT](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/centre-for-data-ethics-and-innovation/about#:~:text=As%20of%20January%202025%2C%20the,on%20DSIT's%20GOV.UK%20page.), and of course the ongoing [wider restructuring across DSIT / GDS](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2025/01/27/same-name-new-ambitions/). I am usually quite comfortable with uncertainty and change. I grew up in a fairly nomadic setting (thanks to my father's job!), and I have worked in research, where ambiguity is the norm. But this feels different. I have even taken to calling it the "fog of the MoG" (Machinery of Government) (see {{< backlink "20250406_log2" "Log 2">}}), because sometimes it is genuinely hard to figure out what is happening and who does what. Even introducing myself to people can be a challenge at times.

Conversations with seasoned civil servants have reassured me that this is quite a normal part of the job, and that success here is about doing good work _despite_ the change.

### 2. Everything is very siloed
Before I joined, I assumed that working in government would feel like working in one giant, connected organisation. In reality, it is more like working at a subsidiary of a massive conglomerate. Think Google, DeepMind, Waymo and Nest all sitting alongside each other under Alphabet. Everyone technically works in the same ecosystem, but collaboration between parts is not seamless.

Each department functions quite independently, and meaningful join-up at the working level requires conscious effort. This fragmentation really surprised me, especially when it comes to things like data sharing or shared infrastructure. The nature of the work and its sensitivities play a role here, of course, but still, it was an eye-opener. This was something I had not fully appreciated before joining.

### 3. Perfection often trumps progress
One thing I have noticed is a strong tendency toward perfection. Working in the open is not the norm, and I understand why. There are political sensitivities, public scrutiny, and real consequences to getting things wrong.

However, coming from a tech and startup background, I cannot help but think that many of the challenges we face could be addressed better by adopting a more open, iterative approach. Working with the garage doors open, sharing ideas early and learning as we go. 

### 4. Consultations are underrated and underused
Before joining, I had never heard of a public consultation. Having spent some time learning and thinking about them, I have come to see them as a thoughtful mechanism for gathering input and feedback from the public.

Unfortunately, the problem is that they usually have very low engagement rates. There is a lot more potential here. I wonder whether technology could be used to help reframe consultations as opportunities for real dialogue and co-creation.

### 5. I am a builder at heart
I came into this role as a bit of an experiment, hoping to gain an understanding of how 'policy land' works. I have enjoyed the work and absolutely love my colleagues. There is something refreshingly different about the civil service culture, though I cannot quite put my finger on it. But I do miss building, learning, and growing.

The moments that have stood out most for me this year were when I got to deliver something tangible. Two projects in particular:
* *The AI Knowledge Hub:* A fast-paced build that brought together user needs, delivery pressure, and strategic thinking.
* *The Manchester Prize:* A chance to shape something meaningful. It aims to support the use of AI for public good and help drive economic growth. It also led to some fascinating conversations with people in the energy sector and helped me understand the challenges they face.

Those experiences reminded me that I get the most energy from making things, learning new skills, and having conversations with people.

## Looking Ahead
It has been a busy, strange, insightful, and rewarding year. I still feel like I am learning how _this_ world works, how to navigate its acronyms, lingo, and networks. But I am grateful for the exposure I have had, the people I get to work with, and the chance to make things that matter.

I am looking forward to seeing what year two has in store for me. ðŸš€
