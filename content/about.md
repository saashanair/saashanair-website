title: Hi, I am Saasha 👋
---


I am a Tech Policy Advisor to the UK Government, where I focus on responsible AI practices. Before this, I worked as an AI Researcher specialising in the reliable control of safety-critical systems (specifically, autonomous vehicles and data centres) in both industry and academia. This journey has taken me to Munich, Pisa, Cambridge, and London, where I am currently based. I have also had the chance to work as a contractor for an F1 consultancy, applying AI to the domain (yep, Grand Prix F1, and no I did not get free tickets, much to my disappointment 🥲).

When I am not working, I am diving into new interests, whether through reading, writing, or coding. I cannot resist going down rabbit holes of curiosity, which, to be honest, makes introducing myself a bit tricky. But then I stumbled upon the term _multipotentialite_, and it felt like someone had made up that word just for me! While I would love to present a flawless version of myself online, I will admit that I spend more time than I would like on Netflix, YouTube and the like. But hey, that definitely counts as 'quality time with my partner' 👀.

As cliché as it sounds, traveling is another big love of mine. In 2023, my partner and I spent one week every month outside the UK, immersing ourselves in new cultures, tasting local food, and meeting new people. I definitely miss that lifestyle now, though it has been harder to maintain with my current role.

Right now, my big long-term goals are to dabble in entrepreneurship (the *indie hacker route*, since I do enjoy my job!) and to write a book. While I’ve written a textbook called 'Introduction to Reinforcement Learning' for a German university, it doesn’t really count as a ‘real’ book since it’s only available to students in the course.

Well, that was a lot about me! If any of this resonates, please reach out, whether for a collaboration, a casual chat, or even a coffee. ☕️
