**TL;DR:** The Launch Edition: AI Knowledge Hub is finally live! 🚀

It has been a while since I last wrote. It is definitely not intentional, and I haven’t been dodging {{< backlink "weeknotes_20250330" "the challenge">}}. Life has just been, well let’s just say... ‘intense’. After back-to-back 14-hour days, weekend sprints, and a never-ending to-do list, [my baby is finally out in the world](https://ai.gov.uk/knowledge-hub/)! 🚀

I will write a separate post reflecting on the [AI Knowledge Hub](https://ai.gov.uk/knowledge-hub/) soon (because it deserves its own spotlight), but for now: the last three weeks have been extremely bitty. Calls, content design, planning, tweaking, and firefighting, basically doing whatever needed to happen to hit our launch date. And we did it!

What made it all worthwhile? User research calls. Hearing things like:
> This is exactly what I need.” <br/>
> “This is absolutely brilliant.

Those moments lit the fire that kept me going. More soon, once I catch my breath.
