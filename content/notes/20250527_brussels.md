We spent this past weekend in Brussels, arriving Saturday night (24 May) and leaving Monday afternoon (26 May). Most of the time was spent catching up on sleep (see: {{< backlink "20250524_log6" "log #6">}}), but we did manage to squeeze in some excellent food and drink.

### Here is a quick roundup of what we enjoyed:
* **Waffles from Maison Dandoy:** A bit pricey and quite touristy-looking. Under normal circumstances, we would have skipped it. But it came highly recommended by our walking tour guide, so we gave it a shot. We tried the classic combo of chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream, and honestly, I get the hype. The waffle was delicious, but the ice cream was out of this world.The service was a bit slow, though. The takeaway orders seemed to move faster. Next time, we would love to try one of the yellow trucks. Apparently, they are more authentic and reasonably priced.

* **Frites Atelier:** The fries were seriously crispy and addictive. We wanted more even though we were already full. We tried the Indo peanut sauce, which was good, but if I went again, I’d just get the classic fries with their truffle mayo (that truffle sauce is so good).

* **La Mer du Nord / Noordzee:** An outdoor seafood bar that seemed popular with locals. The shrimp croquettes with tartare sauce hit the spot. Johan loved the razor clams, though I wasn’t a fan (something about the texture didn’t quite do it for me).

* **Damn Good Coffee:** We stepped in because of the name. And yes, the coffee lived up to it. Damn good indeed.
* **Knees to Chin:** Great for a grab-and-go snack. We tried the chicken rice paper roll with peanut sauce. It was light, fresh, and tasty.
* **Beer:**
    * **Flores Cactus at Delirium Bar:** sweet, refreshing, and maybe my new favourite beer (disappointed that I can’t find it here in the UK).
    * **La Chouffe on tap at Flamingo:** the place has a great atmosphere and super friendly staff.

It was a short and sleepy trip. Exactly what I needed!
