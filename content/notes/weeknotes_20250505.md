The 28th of April wrapped up our {{< backlink "weeknotes_20250504" "whirlwind of an adventure across India">}}. A short flight to Bangalore from Pune, followed by 11 hours in the air that felt neverending, finally got us back to London. It felt so good to be home! After the all-nighters, airport lounges, constant movement and overstimulation, stepping into our flat felt like entering another dimension. The calm and quiet was truly welcome. Seeing my plant babies alive and thriving made me really happy. That night,  I slept like a baby. I even skipped dinner. Sleeping in my own bed after ten days of hotel-hopping, trains, and flights felt like pure bliss.

The rest of the week was quite uneventful in comparison. The exhaustion of the full trip took over me, and I ended up being extremely slow at work. I barely had the energy to get through the working week.

I did attend the Quantum Fundamentals course by the Imperial Policy Forum on Friday. I was quite excited for it, but it turned out to be dull. The sessions were either too theoretical or too high-level, nothing that tied the tech to the real world. To celebrate making it through the full week and to soak in the rare London sun, Johan and I made our way to Hyde Park in the evening with a bottle of wine and a bag of crisps.

The weekend was for recuperating, unpacking, and getting ready for the coming weeks. With the launch of one of the projects that I am working on coming up in two and a half weeks, life is about to get really busy! So the long bank holiday weekend was definitely appreciated to help catch a breath before the next sprint begins.
