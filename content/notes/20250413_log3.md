**TL;DR:** Bitty week, but lovely weekend in Porto;

This week’s notes are coming to you from a tiny speciality coffee shop in the heart of Porto. I have got a warm mocha in hand (because of course!), reflecting on a week that was not particularly exciting. The work week felt very bitty with lots of back-to-back meetings as I wrap things up before heading out on leave next week.

The weekend, though, was lovely. I took Friday off and properly unplugged (not entirely by choice to be honest, I’m not allowed to work from outside the UK!). We spent the long weekend soaking up the sun, eating incredible food, sipping amazing wine, and wandering along the Douro river. Feel completely recharged for the crazy week ahead.

### What else?
* Got a bunch of interest in the product I’m building, thanks to a shoutout in the cross-departmental AI newsletter. 
* Made a new friend and had a great chat about AI and data privacy. We could’ve kept going if not for my next meeting. The convo did spark ideas for a writing series (unsure when I’ll be able to get to it though).
* Found out I’ve been selected for an “Intro to Quantum for Policymakers” course hosted by Imperial. Very excited for it, but I will be missing day one as I’ll still be out of the country.

Okay, see ya, time to get back to exploring the city. 👋
