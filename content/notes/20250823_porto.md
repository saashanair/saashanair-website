Johan and I {{< backlink "20250413_log3" " visited Porto in April">}}, and it has quickly become one of our favourite cities. The kind we can’t stop recommending to friends. From the flavorful food to the warm, friendly locals and the effortlessly charming vibe of the city, Porto has it all. This post is our way of making it easier to share our Porto recommendations.

### Food:
* **Gazela:** The Cachorrinho (also known as the Traditional Hot Dog if you are handed the English menu) is an absolute must! Crispy, spicy and absolutely addictive. From the very first bite, we were hooked. We ended up going there almost every evening and even packed some for our return to London. If you try only one thing in Porto, make it this.

* **Restaurante Lameiras:** For affordable and flavorful local eats, this is the spot. We tried a few dishes, but the highlight was the Frango de Churrasco (grilled chicken). No surprise at all that this dish is their speciality. Don’t forget to ask for the piri-piri sauce. But a word of caution: it packs a punch, the mouth-numbing kind! We learnt that the hard way.
* **Brasão Aliados:** One of the fancier spots on this list. We went mainly for the Francesinha, as our first choices were closed. We were a little apprehensive going in, expecting it to be touristy and very average, but we were pleasantly surprised. We would recommend the croquettes and the truffle rissol as well. We were not disappointed by the order!

* **Casa Guides:** Johan rated their Da Casa sandwich very highly. I went for the Cachorro, which I would not recommend (not all Cachorrinho are created equal, stick with Gazela!).

### Experiences / Drinks: 
* **Porto Walkers, Port Wine Tour:** Free walking tours are always a great way to get a feel for a city. When we realized the company also offered Port Wine Tours, and there were spots for the evening tour, we jumped on it. Though not huge fans of port wine, this tour changed our mind. Three hours, four wineries, and plenty of tastings later, we gained a newfound appreciation for port wine and its complex flavours.

* **Capela Incomum:** If you are in a bit of a “sinful” mood, visit this 16th-century chapel turned bar. Nestled in a quiet, non-touristy neighbourhood, it is a unique experience. The altar and interior details are beautifully preserved, adding to the atmosphere. They offer a curated selection of Portuguese wines, and the staff are fantastic at guiding you to something perfect.

Porto left us with full hearts, happy taste buds, and a desire to return soon!
