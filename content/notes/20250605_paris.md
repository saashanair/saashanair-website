With my brother-in-law living and working in Paris, Johan and I find ourselves visiting the city more often these days. Each trip is an opportunity to explore a little more. I am maintaining this as a living list of our favourite places to eat and drink in the city.

- **Mian Fan Dumpling Factory**: Tucked away and easy to miss, this spot delivers bold, satisfying flavours. Our favourites so far are *The Spicy Lover* and *Like a Dan Dan*. Warm, comforting, and with just the right amount of spicy kick, this place always hits the spot. Next on our list is the intriguingly named Black Mush Mush, which seems to be a local favourite.
- **Donatien Maître Éclair**: This place has entirely redefined what an éclair can be. Their savoury versions are exceptional, and the truffle éclair has become something of a tradition for us. We always make time for a visit.
- **The French Bastards**: If you enjoy a sweet treat, their éclairs and banana cake are dangerously good. We often walk in for one thing and end up leaving with a small assortment of desserts we had no intention of buying.
- **Peppe Pizzeria**: As devoted fans of truffle, the Queen Tartufo pizza holds a special place in our hearts. A suggestion: take your pizza to go and enjoy it by the Louvre, with the Eiffel Tower shimmering in the distance.
